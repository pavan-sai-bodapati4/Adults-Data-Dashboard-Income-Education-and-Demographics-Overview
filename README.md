  Visual Insights:
## 1. Education-Number vs Income:  
Higher education numbers (e.g., 9, 10, 13) correspond to a significantly higher count of individuals  
earning above $50K.  
Lower education levels show minimal representation in high-income groups.  
## 2. Education vs Above/Below $50K:  
Bachelors, Masters, Doctorate, and some-college categories dominate higher-income counts.  
High school graduates (HS-grad) and below mostly fall into the below $50K category.  
## 3. Marital Status vs Income:  
Married individuals (especially “Married-civ-spouse”) show a strong correlation with earning above $50K.  
Never-married individuals have lower high-income counts.  
## 4. Gender vs Education:  
Across all education levels, males have higher representation in the above $50K category compared to females.  
Females are more concentrated in lower-income brackets for the same education level.
